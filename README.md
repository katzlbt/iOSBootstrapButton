#BButton 2.0 Forked (iOS7, iOS8, 64bit)

BButton is a subclass of UIButton that looks like the [Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.1](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) buttons.
BBIconLabel is a new class to display Icons without button. With a single method call it can be set up to convert entered text in InterfaceBuilder to Icons and scale them. No need to write code.
For a working demo see this project: git@github.com:katzlbt/iOSBootstrapButtonDemo.git
iOS7, iOS8 compatible for those who do not like the new design (yuk!). 

#Adding BootstrapButton to your project

```git submodule add git@github.com:katzlbt/iOSBootstrapButton.git``` BootstrapButton
XCode5 will ask you "Share working copy?" Answer: NO (not sure what this means though)

#Using BootstrapButton in your project

__In InterfaceBuilder change the class-name of your Button from UIButton to BButton. That's it.__
In InterfaceBuilder change the class-name of your Button from UIButton to BRadioButton. Then connect toNextRadioButton outlets in the storyboard in a circle (linked list) so the button may deselect others. Then set the selectedColor in the KV-coding list to blue or red and use the radio button. No code needed.
To programatically use the buttons (you don't need to do that at all) check out the demo XCode project http://github.com/katzlbt/iOSBootstrapButtonDemo that contains this project as subproject.

### Changes
* Added BRadioButton
* Removed unnecessary methods, cleanup
* Refactored to be able to use Icomoon Font or any other Font in Buttons.
* Switched from Arrays to memory friendier #define structure.
* Deprecated NSString extensions
* TODO: Draw icon separately of text as this thinns the label font from bold to regular (and loose the ability to display 2+ icons?)
* Addedd BBIconLabel class

## How To Use

### With Storyboards

Create a `UILabel` and change its class to `BBIconLabel` Then add a method to translate the text you set in IB as label text to icons.
[BBIconLabel setTextToIconMap:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: FAIconRemove, "#IL1", nil]];
